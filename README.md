# TensorFlow-Hub-and-Transfer-Learning
In this repository, I have used transfer learning where the pre-trained models are taken from TensorFlow Hub.

**Transfer Learning**: A technique that reuses a model that was created by machine learning experts and that has already been trained on a large dataset.
